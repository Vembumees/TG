	So what is the current gameplan? 11.may 2020
	small metrdoivania style area, Castle of a great powerful mage (Merlin?),
	where powerful mages from around the world have come to battle eachother with 
	unique arcane scrolls created by Merlin. Scrolls are found around the castle.
	Castle is full of monsters, secret areas and mages. Normal magic is almost useless
	against most of the monsters. Castle's mages are mostly nonhostile and can only be
	fought in a duel with the scrolls with a dark pact, because that's the only way to
	obtain their scroll.

	Scrolls = cards.
