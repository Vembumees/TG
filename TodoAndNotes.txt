Small game where you fly around space and so some random whatever stuff i decide to implement.
Nothing fancy here. Just a place to hack some broken code together.

TODO:
	*some basic card class
	*card UI stuff
	*card combat
	
	*shop to buy cards
	*mini dialogue widget
	
	
Notes:
	idk really what to do exactly atm. On one side I want to do the experimental "complex"
	inventory health/Damage system. On the other side maybe it feels too weird and bad and 
	overly complicated. Maybe should just try to get basic system first. Like slay the spire
	cards and combat.

	But simple idea atm was to make cards that just deal damage, heal, give armor etc basic thing.
	But have very powerful random side effects (on card creation). That can also change the world.
	For example if you want to deal high damage you might have to destroy an ally, trader, wipe
	your resources, summon enemies near you, make everything more dangerous or whatever.


	Other concept that atm came to me with the inventory grid is that we collect cards to our 
	2x3 or whatever small inventory and whenever we get dealt damage, it damages a random grid.
	Maybe like we get 3 dmg, it targets 3 grids randomly and deals them 1 damage. Or 3 damage 
	over 3 turns on one tile. Or something like that. Maybe separate damage cards for them.
	And if our grid hp goes 0 the card inside gets destroyed. So whenever we take damage we need
	to sacrifice what cards we permamently will lose. When we use cards we use them from the grid
	inventory and they go on cooldown. Can do plenty of the standard stuff with the grid. fire, water,
	freeze etc with the grids. Tho those are kind of common now (tho most ppl i reckon havent also
	played all this type of card combat games :D). But yeah, when I get there I'll think it through more.
