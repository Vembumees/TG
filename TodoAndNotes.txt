Small game where you fly around space and so some random whatever stuff i decide to implement.
Nothing fancy here. Just a place to hack some broken code together.

	So what is the current gameplan? 11.may 2020
	small metrdoivania style area, Castle of a great powerful mage (Merlin?),
	where powerful mages from around the world have come to battle eachother with 
	unique arcane scrolls created by Merlin. Scrolls are found around the castle.
	Castle is full of monsters, secret areas and mages. Normal magic is almost useless
	against most of the monsters. Castle's mages are mostly nonhostile and can only be
	fought in a duel with the scrolls with a dark pact, because that's the only way to
	obtain their scroll.

	Scrolls = cards.
	
	Scroll is basically a small deck of cards. When used, it draws a random power that the player can use.
	The objective of the game is to obtain multiple scrolls and win against the opponents by combining
	them. Scrolls can be found around the castle, secret areas, monsters and other duelists.
	Mostly I imagine atm that a scroll should just have 1-4 spells in it.

	Having scrolls should also affect the player. 
	The player finds a scroll of darkness. To enable it he imprints the scroll on himself.
	Now the scroll can be used in a duel and also gives the player character some powers.

	Basically the game is 2 games in one - duel card battler and metroidvania and the idea is to
	infuse them both and try a lot of weird ideas that haven't been explored.

	It eventually should be more a duel game with party members. Not just 1 v 1. Like dungeon crawler.
	If you are alone you will be facing duels vs multiple players. So you want to recruit some people/make friends.
	But this is atm way too far away to develop, have to make the basic game work first :D. 

	Game should be somewhat short, but replayable game. Not much random generation, but 
	very challenging and randomization in the wizards/drops. For example maybe have that each
	run has a different villain. The winner gets to rule the castle and each battle you
	fight a previous most powerful mage.
