	*work on projectile, collisions.
	*item objects should be floating, probably need a linetrace check below them and fall if its beyond x and otherwise chillfloat in air
	*work on AI
	
	UI
		*options menu
		*inventory
		*enemy inventory
		*player equipment
		*enemy equipment
		*enemy drop stuff from inventory on death
		*inventory slot health/damage (this is probably gonna be huge and mega confusing/hard/buggy I imagine for me at least)
		*inventory slot destroy items on death
		*inventory slot statuses, frozen, burning, corrupted etc stuff like that (might be cool if it could modify items)


		*implement event messages and error messages for world/inventory etc. Like inventory is full. Entered new area and stuff.
		 already have code in hexproject for this

Notes:

	Mystery of RefreshInventorySlots() when moving items in inventory inside inventorywidget, idk why, but the references don't
	seem to update properly somewhere for some reason. It isn't bad, but it's causing some clutter code I think which could be avoided,
	I just don't understand	why this needs to be called before doing the logic to move the item otherwise the UI doesn't update properly.
	I don't understand how my 100% my own written code works.
