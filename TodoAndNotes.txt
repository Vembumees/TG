Small game where you fly around space and so some random whatever stuff i decide to implement.
Nothing fancy here. Just a place to hack some broken code together.

	So what is the current gameplan? 11.may 2020
	small metrdoivania style area, Castle of a great powerful mage (Merlin?),
	where powerful mages from around the world have come to battle eachother with 
	unique arcane scrolls created by Merlin. Scrolls are found around the castle.
	Castle is full of monsters, secret areas and mages. Normal magic is almost useless
	against most of the monsters. Castle's mages are mostly nonhostile and can only be
	fought in a duel with the scrolls with a dark pact, because that's the only way to
	obtain their scroll.

	Scrolls = cards.
	
	Scroll is basically a small deck of cards. When used, it draws a random power that the player can use.
	The objective of the game is to obtain multiple scrolls and win against the opponents by combining
	them. Scrolls can be found around the castle, secret areas, monsters and other duelists.
	Mostly I imagine atm that a scroll should just have 1-4 spells in it.

	Having scrolls should also affect the player. 
	The player finds a scroll of darkness. To enable it he imprints the scroll on himself.
	Now the scroll can be used in a duel and also gives the player character some powers.

	Basically the game is 2 games in one - duel card battler and metroidvania and the idea is to
	infuse them both and try a lot of weird ideas that haven't been explored.

	It eventually should be more a duel game with party members. Not just 1 v 1. Like dungeon crawler.
	If you are alone you will be facing duels vs multiple players. So you want to recruit some people/make friends.
	But this is atm way too far away to develop, have to make the basic game work first :D. 

	Game should be somewhat short, but replayable game. Not much random generation, but 
	very challenging and randomization in the wizards/drops. For example maybe have that each
	run has a different villain. The winner gets to rule the castle and each battle you
	fight a previous most powerful mage.


	Idea: Castle is full of weird monsters. Every time you play a duel, the loser turns into a monster.
	So each combat vs NPC is a duel that also ends with a real time combat encounter. Combat should be 
	kind of easy tho. If I do some kind of checkpoint saving where player can also die after winning a duel
	and having to restart (which is unfun), I could use it as an advantage tho to make powerful cards that 
	have sideeffects that affect your real combat. Like you gain a powerful damage boost in cards, but each 
	time you use a card you summon a monster close to you who will attack you after duel is over. Cards that 
	make you extremely weak etc. So you can use a cheat trick to win a duel, but by doing that you can just 
	make yourself lose in the realtime combat.

	Big point of the game should be that the Boss duels should be epic. That's the goal of the game.
	Epic battles. With weird powerful scary enemies. Like yugioh duel monsters. Duels that hype up.
	And raise the stakes. The duel consumes the loser and each side makes big sacrifices and you 
	constantly have to sacrifice your ability to beat the game just to win a duel. That's the point of 
	the game. Can I make it? Hell no. I am way too beginner to make this type of stuff happen well :D.
	But if I work hard for months I can make at least hopefully something that resembles the idea :D.

	Another dumb idea for realistic speed: how about we make it 1 bit game...Except magic. The entire game
	and characters are all 1 bit. But Magic has colors/effects/lighting etc.
