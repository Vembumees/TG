Small game where you fly around space and so some random whatever stuff i decide to implement.
Nothing fancy here. Just a place to hack some broken code together.

TODO:
	*card widget class
	*card manager - manages effects, damage, etc
	*card UI small effects stuff
	*card combat
	
	*basic stats ui widget

	*inventory grid for cards

	*shop to buy cards
	*mini dialogue widget
	
	
Notes:
	idk really what to do exactly atm. On one side I want to do the experimental "complex"
	inventory health/Damage system. On the other side maybe it feels too weird and bad and 
	overly complicated. Maybe should just try to get basic system first. Like slay the spire
	cards and combat.

	But simple idea atm was to make cards that just deal damage, heal, give armor etc basic thing.
	But have very powerful random side effects (on card creation). That can also change the world.
	For example if you want to deal high damage you might have to destroy an ally, trader, wipe
	your resources, summon enemies near you, make everything more dangerous or whatever.


	Other concept that atm came to me with the inventory grid is that we collect cards to our 
	2x3 or whatever small inventory and whenever we get dealt damage, it damages a random grid.
	Maybe like we get 3 dmg, it targets 3 grids randomly and deals them 1 damage. Or 3 damage 
	over 3 turns on one tile. Or something like that. Maybe separate damage cards for them.
	And if our grid hp goes 0 the card inside gets destroyed. So whenever we take damage we need
	to sacrifice what cards we permamently will lose. When we use cards we use them from the grid
	inventory and they go on cooldown. Can do plenty of the standard stuff with the grid. fire, water,
	freeze etc with the grids. Tho those are kind of common now (tho most ppl i reckon havent also
	played all this type of card combat games :D). But yeah, when I get there I'll think it through more.

	Card
	Quick brainstorm

	class Card;
		*we want card to have name, image, description. basic stats. And Effect enum. 
		we put it all in a struct. Card gets the data from a datatable, this way we can 
		easily create cards in datatable.

		1)
		Enum that lists all card effects, even ones like +1 dmg, +2 dmg etc.

		class EffectMgr manages the effect logic. Like when we use the card, it calls effectMgr, which
		asks the effect enum which effect it wants and plays the effect function on the target.

	How should it work?
	We select card, Call UseCard(), select the target we will use the effect on, then the card
	calls the effectmanager to who we pass the target. The effectmanager calls the effect.
	Now how do we do the card? I think it should be possible to just give cards ID and that all. Based 
	on ID, effectmanager should be able to get the effect itself. Tho in this case, targeting should
	also be done by the effect manager inside the effect function. But whatever. Lets start by figuring
	things out.

	inventory/life grid
	this is basically ship's defences

	entities that have this inventory aka creatures have inventory component.
	But atm I think only player should have this.

	3x3 or whatever, expandable, upgradable etc grid.
	consists of 
	Widgets
	1)slot - has life, depending on life changes color, this is background just for color indication
	2)button - this is basically item slot, this has the image of the item/card and you click on item to use it.
	3)Inventory bar widget, this is where all the slots are created.

	Manager
	4)inventory component

	??
	Do I hold life in slot or inventory manager? I think slot. But I could hold all in inventory manager
	and call Update() every time I do an action that updates the slot by ID that got modified. If I want to
	buff a slot, where do I call? Will try to get the rest of this stuff somehow work then think.

	Where I left off?
	To make inventory component and widgets. Havent started. Start building the shipinventory.
