BIG OVERHAUL
Now it will be a diablo theme inspired village defense game. With a bunch of weird different way the things work. Goal is to
make a mini game that gives a diablo 1 vibe, but that feels fresh :). Hopefully I manage to do the assets and get the basic playable
prototype done with nice visuals done within this year :). Very hyped, if I work hard this could be THE game for me at least!

paper2d metroidvania currently developing, fully in c++ and trying to create everything myself and create some new mechanics/systems,
so includes a bunch of spaghetti code. Currently only been working on it for few weeks.
