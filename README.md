paper2d metroidvania currently developing, fully in c++ and trying to create everything myself and create some new mechanics/systems,
so includes a bunch of spaghetti code. Currently only been working on it for few weeks.

basic npc that player can interact and have a dialogue with.
damageable world objects
basic inventory
items
item functionality (spell tomes cast spells on use)
basic enemy ai run/attack.
all npcs, objects, items etc are created on datatable data.
and a bunch of bugs and no polish
