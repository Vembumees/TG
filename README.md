June 18. Currently has a small inventory/equipment/barebones dialogue, weird main menu, very barebones clunky ai and basic movement/attack/cast ability using items, started doing another project that involves a little bit less realtime sprites :). Planned to make it as a small defense game from monster waves, with turn based monster fights with cards. Maybe will finish up some of the features once in a while, right now could be a graveyard project :)

Edit: 2020.07
Took from few screenshots, I did some weird stuff after the last screenshot here. Had a weird main menu plan and did this really weird toolbox menu and I was thinking about making a small minigame off of it (but I'm always too lazy to do small android games, even if it takes just a week xD). I just kind of like the small inventory xD. All assets here were free assets didnt make anything except grids :D.
