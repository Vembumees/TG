June 18. Currently has a small inventory/equipment/barebones dialogue, weird main menu, very barebones clunky ai and basic movement/attack/cast ability using items, started doing another project that involves a little bit less realtime sprites :). Right now could be a graveyard project :)

Edit: 2020.07
Took from few screenshots, I did some weird stuff after the last screenshot here. Had a weird main menu plan and did this really weird toolbox menu and I was thinking about making a small minigame off of it (but I'm always too lazy to do small android games, even if it takes just a week xD). The AI is very buggy and it didn't even work so if anyone checking it out definitely keep out. Most of the code is pretty bad :D. This project was mostly me trying to get things done without googling which resulted a lot of bad solutions and workarounds :D
